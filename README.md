# Responsive-Weather-Forecast-WebApp
Created a website that is used to search for detailed weather report using the Google Geocode and forecast.io API, and the results will be displayed in tabular format using DarkSky API.<br>
(Angular7, NodeJS, JSON, Azure Cloud, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)



<h1>Working behind the Website</h1>
The user provides the location information such as Street address, City and State for which they would want to find the detailed weather information or provide their current location.  
 
Once the user has provided the data and clicks on the Search button, validation must be done to check that the entered data is valid. Once the validation is successful, 3 tabs should be displayed. The 3 tabs correspond to Current tab, Hourly tab and Weekly tab.  

All the API calls from the website(Angular) are made to the setup NodeJS server. Both frontend and backend of the website are hosted on Azure Cloud. 

It also supports adding cities to and removing cities from the Favorites tab and sharing the weather info with Twitter. All the output and their respective screenshots are in the following section.
